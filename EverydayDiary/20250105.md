Light, one of my friends from Bilibili, introduced me to an Australian friend, Chirs. We talked a lot on Telegram. Since then I followed his Instagram, and he told me that he doesnâ€™t usually approve ones that have 0 posts or very few posts, but he had approved mine. Well, I have not posted anything on Instagram. But, it's really an honor for me to have my request approved. Also, I shared some trip videos of mine for Chirs to get to know something in China. What is amazing is that Chris is a tech manager, which means we may be in the same section.

Do you think you'll meet up in person at some point in the future?
